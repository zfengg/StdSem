We first established a concrete setup and some basic intuition on the concerned Markov chain. With the concepts of the mixing times and the cut-off phenomenon, we stated the main theorems and discussed the delicate dependencies of the parameters. Next we introduced the key observation connecting the sum of $\ell_2$ norms and the expectation of the number of the roots of a random polynomial in $\mathbb{F}_p$.

After reviewing the Fourier transform on $\mathbb{F}_{p}$, we established the Konyagin's $ O(\log p \log\log p)$ upper bound on the mixing time. The proof follows Konyagin's orginal idea and relies on the Dobrowolski's lower bound on Mahler measures.

Based on the convolution structure of the envolving measures and the key observation, we applied the Fourier transform and the small-average-control-num-of-large-fibers arguments to obtain an upper bound on the mixing time for general $p$ but not all multipliers with high orders. To prove the $\ell_2$ cut-off phenomenon, a nested version of the aformmentioned argument was conducted via Markov inequality. The complete proof depends an upper bound of an expectation where the GRH came into the game through the key observation.
