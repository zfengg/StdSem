We finished Exercises 1.2, 1.5, 1.38, 1.39, 1.42, 1.44, 1.45, 1.46 and 1.47 in the reference. During this progress, we have learned:
- a trick to combine a sequence of scales in a desired way.
- the power of dimension formula for homogeneous Moran sets. See the section about sets defined via digits in \href{Basics on Moran structures}{/assets/wip/Moran.pdf}. In this joint note, we also record a dimension formula for *perturbed* symmetric Cantor sets	. 
- a combination of two ways of defining sets via digits.
- a principle of choosing *best* Bernoulli measures on sets defined by digit densities.
