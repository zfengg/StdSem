We observe that the projections of every planar homogeneous self-similar set with rational (mod $ \pi $) rotation angle are self-similar sets.

Next we focus on the projections of 1-dim Sierpinski gasket. Let $ \tau \in \mathbb{R} $. Let $ E_{\tau} $ be the attractor of IFS:
\nalign{ \{ 1/3 x, 1/3 x + 2/3, 1/3 x + \tau / 3\}.  }
The following results are known.

- If $ \tau \notin \mathbb{Q} $, then $ \mathcal{L}(E_{\tau}) = 0 $ and $ \dim_{H} E_{\tau} = 1 $.
- If $ \tau = 2 p/q \in \mathbb{Q} $ with $ \gcd(p,q) = 1 $ and $ p + q \equiv 0 \pmod 3 $, then $ \mathcal{L} (E_{\tau}) = 2 / q $ and $ E_{\tau} = \overline{E_{\tau}^{\circ}}  $.
- If $ \tau = 2p/q \in \mathbb{Q} $ with $ \gcd(p,q) = 1 $ and $ p + q \not \equiv 0 \pmod 3 $, then $ \dim_{H} E_{\tau} < 1 $ and $ \dim_{H} E_{\tau} $ can be computed by an algorithm (in finite steps).

The Open Set Condition only holds in the second case. The Exact Overlaps only happen in the third case.

In particular for the Ex 2.7 in B-P, we compute that $ \dim_{H} E_{1/2} = \log_{3}(\frac{\sqrt{5}+3}{2}) $. Then we quickly finish Ex 2.15 and 2.16.
