The main theorem of this article: Arcs of lengths $ l_{n}, 0 < l_{n+1} \leq l_{n}<1, n=1,2, \ldots $, are thrown independently and uniformly on a circumference $ C $ of unit length. The union of the arcs covers $ C $ with probability one if and only if
\nalign{\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-2} \exp \left(l_{1}+\cdots+l_{n}\right)=\infty.}
