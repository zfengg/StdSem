We consider the digits set that each digit occurs with a certain frequency. The resulting sets are dense in $[0,1]$, so we need only consider their Hausdorff dimension and packing dimension.

Let 
\nalign{A_{p}=\left\{x=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_{n} 2^{-n}: x_{n} \in\{0,1\}, \lim _{j \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{j} \sum_{k=1}^{j} x_{k}=p\right\}.}
Thus $A_{p}$ is the set of real numbers in $[0,1]$ in which a 1 occurs in the binary expansion with asymptotic frequency $p$. We show that
 
*Theorem 1.* For any $p\in  (0,1)$,
\nalign{\operatorname{dim}\left(A_{p}\right)=h_{2}(p)=-p \log _{2} p-(1-p) \log _{2}(1-p).}
where $\dim$ denotes the Huasdorff dimension or packing dimension.
